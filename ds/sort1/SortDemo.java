Setup:
 1.Make a folder under your work repo named: ds
 2. Make another folder under that named sort1
 3. Copy this file and SortDemoDriver.java into the ds/sort1 folder
Lab:
Part 1:
  1. Analyze the two constructors - try to figure out how they work.
  2. Compile and run the program (SortDemoDriver.java and SortDemo.java) and confirm
   the behavior of the constructors.
Part 2:
  1. Read the description of findSmallestIndex and complete the method.
  2. Uncomment the lines in SortDemoDriver to test.
Part 3:
  1. Complete the sort method - read comments for description
  2. Uncomment the lines in sortDemoDriver to test.
