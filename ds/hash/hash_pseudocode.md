phoneNumber

Driver class
Print customers



    	Methods
PhoneBook class

Driver class
Main ()
Key

The hash table is 100 address 0-99
key= ascii (lastName) Mod 100
Resolve collision: by using a link list

hasKey(lastName) Method
Return Key = ascii(lastName) mod 100

get(lastName) Method
hashKey(lastName)
